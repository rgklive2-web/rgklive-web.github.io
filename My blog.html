        <p>
            The journey began even before the bus moved. I stood at the platform with my backpack — heavier than usual, 
            not because of clothes or gadgets, but because of the thoughts I carried quietly inside me. Worries, curiosity, 
            a strange restlessness, and that gentle spark of excitement only travel can stir.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the bus finally rolled out of the city, it moved slowly, almost respectfully, as if giving me a final moment 
            to look at the familiar world I was leaving behind. Buildings shrank, streetlights stretched into glowing lines, 
            and the dusty air softened into something lighter. I leaned against the window, watching the roads twist like loose 
            threads tying me to places I hadn’t seen yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the city dissolved behind me, the world opened up — hills rising in the distance, the sky stretching wider, and 
            silence settling over everything like a warm blanket. I didn’t know what waited for me in Munnar, but a quiet feeling 
            told me that this trip wasn’t just about reaching a destination. Something inside me was ready to be found — something 
            I didn’t even know I had misplaced.
        </p>

        <p>
            By dawn, the bus started climbing the hills. The scenery changed all at once. Tall trees stood like silent guardians 
            on both sides of the road. Sunlight filtered through the branches, creating golden freckles on the ground. Sometimes 
            the valley appeared suddenly — wide, deep, layered with greens that slowly dissolved into the clouds.
        </p>
        <p>
            During a small stop, tea workers were beginning their day. The air carried the aroma of fresh chai mixed with the cool 
            mountain breeze. Wrapping my hands around the warm cup, I felt the kind of comfort that doesn’t come from luxury, but 
            from simplicity. For that moment, there was no rush, no deadlines — just the sound of distant birds and the soft rustle 
            of leaves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reaching Munnar felt like walking into a living painting. Tea gardens stretched endlessly, like rolling waves frozen 
            mid-motion. Every turn revealed a new shade of green I hadn’t seen before.
        </p>
        <p>
            I checked into a small homestay run by an elderly couple whose smiles were warmer than the morning sun. After resting, 
            I wandered into the tea estate nearby. Dew glistened on every leaf. Gravel cracked softly under my shoes. I felt a 
            peace I hadn’t felt in months — a silence that didn’t feel empty, but inviting.

        <p>
            No real journey happens without unexpected turns — both on the road and inside you.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the second day, thick fog wrapped itself around the hills. Visibility dropped and the once-vibrant mountains turned 
            into quiet silhouettes. Despite the weather, I decided to trek to Top Station. Halfway through, rain began — gentle 
            but persistent — turning the stones slippery and the path uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a moment, doubt crept in. Should I return? Should I push forward?
        </p>
        <p>
            A local guide passed me and smiled. His words still echo in my mind: <strong>“In the hills, the mist hides the view 
            only to make the reveal more special.”</strong> And suddenly, it felt like he wasn’t just talking about the mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I reached the viewpoint, the clouds parted for only a few seconds — but it was enough. The valley opened before 
            me like a secret finally shared. The struggle made the beauty hit harder. I realized that uncertainty isn’t a barrier; 
            it’s a part of the experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Along the way, I met travellers who unexpectedly became part of my story — a cheerful family, a solo biker who had 
            travelled across Ladakh, and a patient photographer waiting hours for the perfect shot. Strangers, yet their presence 
            left marks deeper than some people I’ve known for years.

            Leaving Munnar felt like closing a book whose story you didn’t want to end.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the bus wound down the hills, I watched the tea estates slowly dissolve into the mist. But inside, something had 
            shifted. The journey taught me that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Silence isn’t empty — it’s full of answers we avoid hearing.</li>
            <li>Nature heals, not loudly, but steadily.</li>
            <li>Strangers can become stories that stay with us forever.</li>
            <li>Clarity often comes when you step away from your routine.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If this journey had never happened, I would still be carrying the same heaviness I
